## Whiteboard Process

![Whiteboard](/python/docs/stack_queue_pseudo/CodeChallenge11PseudoQueue.png)

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## Feature Tasks

Create a new class called pseudo queue.

- Do not use an existing Queue.
- Instead, this PseudoQueue class will - implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below),
- Internally, utilize 2 Stack instances to create and manage the queue

Methods:

- enqueue
  - Arguments: value
  - Inserts a value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
- dequeue
  - Arguments: none
  - Extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
