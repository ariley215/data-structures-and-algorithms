# Challenge Title

Implementation: Trees

## Feature Tasks

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node. *completed 01-26-2024 02:30EST*

Binary Tree

- Create a Binary Tree class
- Define a method for each of the depth first traversals:
  - pre order *completed 01-26-2024 02:30EST*
  - in order *completed 01-26-2024 02:30EST*
  - post order *completed 01-26-2024 03:30EST*

Binary Search Tree

- Create a Binary Search Tree class
- This class should be a sub-class (or your languages equivalent) of the Binary Tree Class, with the following additional methods:
  - Add *completed 01-26-2024 03:00EST*
    - Arguments: value
    - Return: nothing
    - Adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
  -Contains *completed 01-27-2024 04:00EST*
    - Argument: value
    - Returns: boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
