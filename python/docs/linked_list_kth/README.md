# Challenge Title

k-th value from the end of a linked list.

## Feature Tasks

kth from end

- argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
- Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
- You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in - previous challenges.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O
Time: O(n) - longer the linked list, the more time it will take to run the function
Space: O(1) - the code takes up the same amount of space no matter the size of the data.

## Solution

python data_structures.linked_list.py
